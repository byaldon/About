# Hi my name is John!


Hello! My name is **John**. I am a developer primarily focused on **[WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress "WordPress")**. This is where my main expertise lies. I work on creating plugins and themes, and I have a vision of eventually developing my own WordPress system that will be fully transparent regarding privacy.

In my free time, I sometimes engage in other projects, such as creating apps for **[Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")**. I also develop web applications and software for **[Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Windows")** and **[Android](https://tinu.be/EkuommdT9)**.

After a long journey of self-discovery regarding what I want to do with my life, I have realized that design and programming are my true passions, and I often dedicate a lot of time to them.

I want to focus on the transparency of privacy. I aim to be honest and open about this. I will never collect data without consent. Your data is your data, and you are the one who decides what happens to it.

I intend to use this GitHub primarily as a sort of **portfolio**, but I mainly utilize it for hosting my programming projects.

### Summary of the Name Aldon and Its Symbolism

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f99a7c7-8b42-4c93-8145-7324d7ef0a6f" alt="Owl and Book" style="width: 350px; height: auto;"/>



The name **Aldon** is a creative blend that resonates with themes of wisdom and age. Derived from the elements "old" and "man," it embodies the essence of an "old wise man," reflecting a deep respect for knowledge and experience.

Accompanying this name is a striking image of an **owl perched on an open book**. The owl is a universal symbol of wisdom, often associated with intelligence and insight. Its nocturnal nature signifies keen observation and understanding, making it a fitting representation of the qualities embodied by the name Aldon.

The open book further emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge and learning, suggesting that wisdom is not just inherent but also cultivated through study and experience. Together, the name Aldon and the imagery of the owl and book create a powerful narrative that celebrates the importance of wisdom, learning, and the journey of life.

This combination serves as an inspiring reminder of the value of knowledge and the wisdom that comes with age.

The reason why this is been choosen is not because i want to look smarter then anyone else.. Because i am not.
It just comes from my real name. I did some research on my real first and last name.. And the name Aldon is what came out of this.
